I live in London and work at [Poplar Studio](https://poplar.studio/) as a machine learning engineer, developing various ML-powered products in the augmented reality space.

From Nov 2019 to Apr 2021 I was a data science consultant at FTI Consulting, albeit in a somewhat product-focused role. Before that, I graduated with an MMath (a 4-year integrated Master's) in Mathematics from Oxford University. During my university years, I did a few internships, including a stint at [BibliU](https://bibliu.com/) in London and [Bestat Data](https://www.bestat-data.com/) in Tokyo. I also got involed in a few hackathons, and some voluntary work.

Here are some non-work facts about me:

- I live, and work, in the East End of London.
- When I listen to music it tends to be (progressive) rock, electronica and classical. My favourite band is Kraftwerk.
- I love cooking and eating Japanese and Indian food.
- I grew up in Dorking and spent the first 18 years of my life there.
