## 13/02/25 Two day Porto trip

We saw some of Porto, including a trip to Portuguese Flannel where I bought a shirt, before crossing over to Villa Nova de Gaia. First we stopped for a **Quinta De Noval 10 year tawny**.

I would describe the taste as silky. It's like you're eating something which melts in your mouth. The tawny was served slightly chilled.

The next stop is **Porto Cruz**, where we had another **10 year tawny**. The wine was almost orange as it poured out of the bottle. However taste standard!

We left early the following morning to tour the Duoro valley. Our first stop was at **Croft's estate**, where we had a **white port, ruby** and **reserve tawny**.
