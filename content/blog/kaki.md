Kaki is an example of how a resteraunt can get so mugh right, and yet so much wrong at the same time.

Let's start with the good. A vibrant menu offers "numbing" frogs legs and rabbit, spiced with "tons" of peppercorn and red chilli. The decor is attractive and modern — Kaki opened in January 2023. I opted for a dry hot-pot.

This Sichuan restaurant is new as of January 2023. Situated on Caledonian Road, the terrace with a canal view must be a good spot to eat, in summer at least. The night I dined there was a bitterly cold one, and the cold crept in to the restaurant. The single glazed windows and single layer brick walls are attractive, but contributed to a somewhat uncomfortable evening.

The main dish, a dry hot pot to share, was good enough, although hardly "numbing" as advertised — it would have to be considerably spicier to meet that description. What let the meal down was the rice: dry, and luke-warm.

_Price guide: £20-25 per person, excluding drinks._
